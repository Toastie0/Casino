## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Card ID System**
Cards use a mathematical ID system (0-51):
```java
// Card ID calculation
cardId = (value - 1) * 4 + suit

// Examples:
// Ace of Spades: 0
// King of Hearts: 51
// 7 of Clubs: 25
```

### **NBT Data Structure**
```java
// Card NBT
{
    "CardID": 0-51,        // Which card
    "SkinID": 0-3,         // Card back design
    "Covered": true/false, // Face-up or face-down
    "CustomModelData": 0-3 // For texture variants
}

// Deck NBT
{
    "SkinID": 0-3,         // Deck design
    "CardsLeft": 0-52,     // Cards remaining
    "NextCardId": 0-51     // Next card to draw
}
```

### **Economy Architecture**
- **Server-Side**: All economy operations handled on server
- **Client-Side**: Balance caching for display
- **Reflection**: Impactor integration uses reflection (no compile dependency)
- **Fallback**: Dummy economy when Impactor unavailable
